    <p>Hello and welcome! This simple website is about my two cats, Zebra and Tater Tot.</p>
    <p>This was made using Flask for UMGC's SDEV 300 class. All photos were taken by me.</p>
    <p>Thank you for browsing and I hope you enjoy!</p>
    <p>Enjoy the same cat video <a href="https://youtu.be/ksnt3kBR9iM">here</a> that you did before you logged in.</p>
